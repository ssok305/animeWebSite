# Use: 
The website provides the top 10 anime and a search function to find animes or movies.

It provides a hyperlink to “MyAnimeList” for extended details.

# API References:
https://jikan.moe/


# Motivation: 
I wanted to create a website that uses an API to use the data gained from it and apply through my own functions and display it on a website

# Ideas/Unable to complete:
I wanted to add a homepage that displays recommendations for anime to the user, but I was unsuccessful when it came to some styling problems that I came across. 

I wanted to include a feature that allows users to create their own profile and save animes that they liked with local storage.
